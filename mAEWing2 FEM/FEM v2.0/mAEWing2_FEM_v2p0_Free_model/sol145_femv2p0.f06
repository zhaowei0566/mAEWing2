   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions.
  
  
      HPC
      -  New ACMS method now supports External Superelement and Adams MNF
           creation.
      -  New ACMS method shows reduced memory requirements, in particular,
           for solid element models.
      -  A new method has been introduced to improve the robustnessof AUTOMSET.
      -  Automatic DMP support for fluid eigensolution problem.
  
      Acoustics
      -  A capability called PEAKOUT has been introduced to calculate the
           acoustic participation factors at the peaks of the frequency
           response.
      -  A new process is available to provide a confidence band associated with
           mid frequency for FRFs (frequency response) when modeling
           uncertainties exist in the stiffness, mass and/or damping in the
           mid-frequency range (300Hz - 1500Hz).
1 
      Embedded-Fatigue
      -  Capability has been extended for fatigue analysis in the (vibratory)
           frequency domain.
  
      Optimization
      -  MSC Nastran Embedded Vibratory Fatigue may be used as an objective or
           constraint in an optimization simulation. This is not available
           for topology optimization.
      -  Topology optimization may now be used to minimize mass under stress
           constraints for solid elements
      - A new manufacturing constraint to control maximum member size in
           topology optimization has been introduced
  
      Rotordynamics
      -  New methods options are available for defining different WR3/WR4
           damping for rotordynamics for individual rotors.
      -  CAMPBELL plots are now available in Sol 110.
      -  2D and 3D Rotors are now supported in SOL 110 and SOL 111.
  
      Implicit Nonlinear Analysis - SOL 400
      -  The Anand solder model has been added, this may also be used for
           creep analysis.
      -  The segment-to-segment method has been enhanced.
      -  Cohesive contact has been introduced to allow user defined normal
           and tangential contact stiffness.
  
      Results Database
      -  Additional data blocks have been added to the HDF5 file.
      -  The intermediate HDF5 is supported through OUTCTRL keyword in NLOPRM
           which allows viewing of the results during the calculation.
  
     Documentation
  
     The complete documentation set is provided in a separate installer and
     when installed is available at:
     MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/pdf_nastran directory.
     Where MSC_DOC_DIR is the directory where documentation was installed
     This help set has cross references between documents, links to how-to
     videos, and example files.
  
     Individual MSC Nastran documents are available for download from the
       Simcompanion Website at:
       http://simcompanion.mscsoftware.com/
